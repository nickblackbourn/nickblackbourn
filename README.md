## 👋 Hi, I'm Nick

Head of Process Intelligence (UK) at Capgemini Invent.

I work at the intersection of **process mining**, **event-log engineering**, **data pipelines**, and emerging **AI-Ops patterns**. This GitHub is where I build practical tools, worked examples, and lightweight prototypes that turn operational data into something organisations can learn from — and act on.

### 🔧 Featured Work

- **Open-Source End-to-End Process Mining** – a minimal pipeline showing how to create a database, load raw data, transform it into an event log, and run PM4Py process discovery.

- **NFL Process Mining Example** – a hands-on worked example turning NFL play-by-play data into a structured event log using SQL and Python.

- **Synthetic Event Log Generator** – a configurable tool for generating realistic event logs for demos, training, and exploratory work.

- **PI Data Assessment Assistant** – an early-stage helper script that performs basic data readiness checks for process mining projects.

If you are exploring modern process intelligence, event-log engineering, or how AI and data engineering can support operational decision-making, feel free to connect or reach out.
