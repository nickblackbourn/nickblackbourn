## 👋 Hi, I'm Nick

I'm Head of Process Intelligence (UK) at Capgemini Invent, specialising in the intersection of **process mining**, **data engineering**, and emerging **AI-Ops** patterns.

My GitHub is where I explore practical, lightweight examples of:

- transforming raw operational data into event logs,
- building mini-tools and scripts to accelerate analysis,
- experimenting with how AI can support (not replace) process intelligence.

### 🔧 Featured Work

- **NFL Process Mining** – a worked example converting NFL play-by-play data into a structured process mining event log using SQL + Python.
- **Synthetic Event Log Generator** – a configurable Python tool for creating synthetic event logs for demos, training, and experimentation.
- *(More PI × AI-Ops experiments coming soon.)*

If you're interested in process intelligence, event logs, or AI-enabled operations, feel free to connect.
